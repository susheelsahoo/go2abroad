# Go2Abroad

Go2Abroad is an npm monorepo for the public website, staff administration
dashboard, student portal, and NestJS backend API.

## Applications

| Application | Directory | Development URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public website | `apps/frontend` | http://localhost:3000 | Public-facing website |
| Admin dashboard | `apps/admin` | http://localhost:3001 | CMS and staff administration |
| Student portal | `apps/student` | http://localhost:3002 | Student-facing application |
| Backend API | `apps/api` | http://localhost:4000 | API, authentication, and content |

The API uses PostgreSQL through Prisma. The reusable page-builder package is in
`packages/page-builder` and is built automatically before the development and
build commands that need it.

## Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- PostgreSQL 14 or newer

Check your installed versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
psql --version
```

## Initial setup

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd go2abroad
npm install
npm --prefix apps/frontend install
npm --prefix apps/admin install
npm --prefix apps/student install
npm --prefix apps/api install
```

Create a PostgreSQL database. The default local connection expected by the
project is `go2abroad` with user `postgres` and password `postgres`:

```bash
createdb go2abroad
```

If your PostgreSQL credentials or database name are different, update
`apps/api/.env` accordingly.

Create the environment files from their examples:

```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env.local
cp apps/admin/.env.example apps/admin/.env.local
```

Review the values in each file. In particular, change the API
`JWT_SECRET`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `SEED_STUDENT_PASSWORD` values.

Generate the Prisma client and apply the database migrations:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run db:generate
npm --prefix apps/api run db:migrate
```

Optionally load the initial data:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run db:seed
npm --prefix apps/api run db:seed:cms
```

## Run all applications together

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This starts all four applications in parallel:

- Website: http://localhost:3000
- Admin: http://localhost:3001
- Student portal: http://localhost:3002
- API: http://localhost:4000
- API health check: http://localhost:4000/health

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all applications.

## Run applications one by one

Open a separate terminal for each application, or run only the application you
need from the repository root.

### Public website

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

### Admin dashboard

```bash
npm run dev:admin
```

Open http://localhost:3001.

### Student portal

```bash
npm run dev:student
```

Open http://localhost:3002.

### Backend API

Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the API setup has been completed first.

```bash
npm run dev:api
```

The API runs at http://localhost:4000. Verify it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

## Run from an individual application directory

The equivalent command can also be run inside an application directory. Run
one command per terminal:

```bash
cd apps/frontend && npm run dev
```

Use `apps/admin`, `apps/student`, or `apps/api` instead of `apps/frontend` for
the other applications.

Run these in separate terminals when you need multiple applications at once.

## Production build and start

Build every package and application from the repository root:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start each built application separately:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/frontend run start
npm --prefix apps/admin run start
npm --prefix apps/student run start
npm --prefix apps/api run start
```

The production ports are the same as the development ports: 3000, 3001, 3002,
and 4000.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run typecheck     # Type-check all applications
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run test:cms      # Build and run the Playwright CMS tests
npm run build:cms     # Build the shared page-builder package
```

Database commands:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run db:studio       # Open Prisma Studio
npm --prefix apps/api run db:migrate      # Create/apply development migrations
npm --prefix apps/api run db:generate     # Regenerate Prisma Client
npm --prefix apps/api run db:seed         # Seed application data
npm --prefix apps/api run db:seed:cms     # Seed page-builder data
```

## Project structure

  frontend/       Public website
  admin/          Staff administration dashboard

  api/            NestJS backend API and Prisma schema
packages/
  page-builder/   Shared page-builder package
```

## Frontend icons

The frontend uses the local `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` package for menu,
navigation, social, and action icons. Keep dependencies installed when setting
up the project because the package also provides the required icon font files.
